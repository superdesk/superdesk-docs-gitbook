# 06 monitoring tab

This is the Monitoring icon on the Workspace Panel.

The Monitoring View is the main workspace for production-side journalists. The content presented in the Monitoring View is controlled from the Hamburger Menu. The idea is to present an overview of the content in each stage of the Desk’s workflow. The Monitoring pane displays the same information to every user on the same Desk. Stages and Saved Searches for the Monitoring pane can be configured by users with the correct permissions from the Desk section of the Hamburger Menu.

This is the Create icon.

New news articles can be created, previewed and edited from the Monitoring pane. To create a new news item, click the Create icon in the top right corner of the Monitoring pane. (As of Superdesk version 1.33, users can also create new content items from any pane using the Create icon in the bottom of the Superdesk interface on any pane, not just the Monitoring pane).

Each user may configure personal Monitoring Views in their Custom Workspaces. A custom Monitoring view can show stages from any Desks the user has permission to see, and views of news items available in Superdesk, including those arriving in ingest feeds matching user-created Saved Searches. However, the Monitoring pane on Desks is set by the desk manager.

The Monitoring Tab in a Custom Workspace enables users whose duties require them to monitor content and activity in more than one desk to do so in a single view, rather than switching between the standard views set for each Desk.

The Monitoring View is usually broken up into Desk Stages. Stages are the way content is sorted within a Desk. Stages are set by the administrator in the Hamburger Menu Desk settings and may vary from desk to desk. Stages could include an input stage, an output stage and a stage for published work, for example. Depending on how your Monitoring has been configured in the Settings menu, you might also see Saved Searches in your Monitoring window.

The Monitoring window has a search feature at the top to help you quickly locate content within your selected desk. Click the search icon to type keywords from headlines, sluglines or body text into the text box, or use the filter buttons located just below the search icon.

The buttons let you filter for a specific type of news item. By default the ALL button is selected and every item is shown. From left to right, the buttons filter for:

* articles that are just text
* photos
* graphics
* packages (items that contain both text and images)
* highlight packages
* videos
* sound files

This is the Create icon.

In the top-right of the Monitoring interface, use the Create icon to make new articles or packages or to upload media from your computer into Superdesk. (See the [Creating New Articles](06-monitoring-tab.md#making-new-articles) section in the Superdesk manual.)

{% hint style="info" %}
As of Superdesk version 1.33, the Monitoring pane features an Advanced Search icon that allows users to filter content by the content profile used in item creation. New filters added to the Monitoring view in future versions will also appear in this widget.
{% endhint %}

This Advanced Search feature makes it easier to browse and find content, especially in newsrooms that use multiple content profiles.

{% hint style="info" %}
As of Superdesk version 1.33, the Monitoring pane also contains a “Marked for Me” button in the right corner. Clicking this button shows items in that Desk that have been tagged for you.
{% endhint %}

If your Monitoring view is set up to show Saved Searches, items in your Saved Search that have been fetched to your desk will be highlighted in light blue with a check mark.
