# 11 spiked items

Spiked items are articles and news items that have been removed from the current Desk’s workflow. Note that spiking an item is different from killing an article. Published articles cannot be spiked, but must be killed instead. Spiking an item is reversible, unless you are spiking an item from your Personal Space, in which case spiking an item will permanently remove it from Superdesk.

Spiked items from your Desk can be viewed by clicking on the Spike icon in the Workspace Panel. Each Desk has its own associated Spike tab.

Items can be spiked from any list view, such as the Monitoring pane, your Custom Workspace, or your Personal Space, etc. Articles spiked from your Personal Space will never be shown in the Spiked Items tab; they will be permanently deleted.

This is the Action menu.

### Spike an item

1. In any list view (Monitoring, Custom Workspace, Personal Space, etc.), hover over the item.
2. Click the Action menu that appears on the right side of the article entry.
3. From the Action menu, select the _Spike Item_ option.

Items can be spiked from any Stage prior to publishing. (Published items cannot be spiked and must be killed instead.)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Unspike an item (return to workflow)

1. Open the Spiked Items tab for your Desk (click the Spike icon in the Workspace Panel).
2. Hover over the spiked article entry to reveal the Action menu.
3. From the Action menu, choose _Unspike Item_.

This will return the article to the Stage and Desk from which it was spiked.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Spiked items are desk-specific: you will only see items that have been spiked from your current Desk (as denoted by your Desks menu).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You cannot spike:

* Items that are part of a package — remove the item from the package first.
* Items that are currently open or locked by another user.
* Published items (published items must be killed instead).
